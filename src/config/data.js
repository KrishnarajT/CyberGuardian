		description:
			" 1) <b>A01:2021-Broken Access Control</b> moved up from the fifth position. 94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control. The 34 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) mapped to Broken Access Control had more occurrences in applications than any other category.  <br/>  <br />  <b>A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures</b> shifts up one position to #2, previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, which was broad symptom rather than a root cause. The renewed focus here is on failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. <br/>  <br /> <b>A03:2021-Injection</b>slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection, and the 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications. Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition. <br/>  <br />     <b>A04:2021-Insecure Design</b> is a new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws. If we genuinely want to “move left” as an industry, it calls for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures.   <br/>  <br />  <b> A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration</b> moves up from #6 in the previous edition; 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it’s not surprising to see this category move up. The former category for XML External Entities (XXE) is now part of this category.   <br/>  <br />  <b> A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components</b> was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores.      <br/>  <br /> <b>A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures</b> was previously Broken Authentication and is sliding down from the second position, and now includes CWEs that are more related to identification failures. This category is still an integral part of the Top 10, but the increased availability of standardized frameworks seems to be helping.    <br/>  <br /> <b> A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures</b> is a new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data mapped to the 10 CWEs in this category. Insecure Deserialization from 2017 is now a part of this larger category.      <br/>  <br /><b>A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures</b> was previously Insufficient Logging & Monitoring and is added from the industry survey (#3), moving up from #10 previously. This category is expanded to include more types of failures, is challenging to test for, and isn’t well represented in the CVE/CVSS data. However, failures in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics.  <br/>  <br />    <b>A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery</b> is added from the Top 10 community survey (#1). The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage, along with above-average ratings for Exploit and Impact potential. This category represents the scenario where the security community members are telling us this is important, even though it’s not illustrated in the data at this time.",

			"<b>What is the Dark Web?</b> <br><br/>  The term dark web sounds ominous, and there's a reason for that. The dark web is a part of the internet that's made up of hidden sites you can't find through conventional web browsers. Instead, you must rely on the Tor browser - a web browser that anonymizes your web traffic within its intenal network and search engines designed specifically to unearth these hidden sites. <br/><br/> Dark web sites use encryption software so their visitors and owners can remain anonymous-it's why the dark web is home to so much illegal activity. However, this side of the internet isn't reserved for criminals. Over 2.7 million active users browse the dark web every day, and many do so for legitimate reasons.  <br/><br/><b>Risks and threats of the dark web</b> <br/><br/> The dark web may be safe in the some cases - think legitimate content-and not in others. Only about 6.7%  of global users use the dark web for malicious purposes,but it's smart to be selective about the websites you access. <br/><br/> Here are a few safety issues to consider.<br/><br/>  <b>Criminals:</b> There’s a chance you will find websites run by criminals. Beyond selling illegal goods and services, they may seek to exploit you and steal from you. <br/><br/>  <b>Breaking the law: </b> You can be prosecuted for things you do on the dark web. It’s important to behave in an appropriate and legal manner.<br/><br/> <b> Viruses:</b> Some websites could infect your devices with viruses, and there are a lot of different types of viruses to watch out for. Remember to never download anything from websites you don’t trust. <br/><br/> <b>Webcam hijacking:</b> A website on the dark web may try to get a remote administration tool—also known as a “RAT”—onto your device. That can lead to someone hijacking your webcam, essentially letting them see what you’re up to through your device’s camera lens. It’s a smart practice to cover your webcam with a piece of paper or tape if you’re not using it. <br/><br/> <b> Hackers </b> You can find hacker forums on the dark web, and you can hire computer hackers to do illegal activities. Not surprisingly, a lot of these people would be willing to hack your devices, too. <br/> <br/> <b> What can you find on the dark web?</b><br/> <br/> You can find legitimate products such as basketball shoes, apparel, research papers, and other items on the dark web. Of course, you can also find plenty of illegal items such as hacked Netflix accounts, stolen Social Security numbers, credit card account numbers, firearms, and drugs, too. <br/><br/> What can you buy on the dark web? Plenty, though much of it you probably shouldn’t be purchasing. <br/><br/> When you’re surfing the darkest corners of the web, you might find people selling:<br/><br/> Stolen credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other private information<br/><br/> Drugs <br/><br/>Firearms<br/><br/> Designer knockoffs <br/><br/>Pornography Stolen account login information <br/><br/>Fake diplomas to Ivy League schools <br/><br/>Fake passports <br/><br/>Malware <br/><br/> But, again, the dark web isn’t just for criminals. You may also come across online versions of books that have long been out of print, collections of political reporting from mainstream news sites, and sites run by whistleblowers looking to expose corporate and government corruption. <br/><br/> <b>  Is it illegal to acccess the dark web? </b> <br/>But you can face criminal charges if you use the dark web to sell or purchase illegal firearms, drugs, pornography, stolen passwords, hacked credit card account numbers, or other items.",

			"<p>      <b>What is Cloud Security?</b><br/><br/>      Cloud security refers to the cybersecurity policies, best practices, controls, and technologies used to secure applications, data, and infrastructure in cloud environments. In particular, cloud security works to provide storage and network protection against internal and external threats, access management, data governance and compliance, and disaster recovery  </p>  <br/><br/>  Cloud computing has become the technology of choice for companies looking to gain the agility and flexibility needed to accelerate innovation and meet the expectations of today’s modern consumers. But migrating to more dynamic cloud environments requires new approaches to security to ensure that data remains secure across online infrastructure, applications, and platforms.       <br/> <br/> <b>Understanding how cloud computing works</b>    <br/> <br/> Cloud computing service models are based on the concept of sharing on-demand computing resources, software, and information over the internet. Companies or individuals pay to access a virtual pool of shared resources, including compute, storage, and networking services, which are located on remote servers that are owned and managed by service providers.       One of the many advantages of cloud computing is that you only pay for what you use. This allows organizations to scale faster and more efficiently without the burden of having to buy and maintain their own physical data centers and servers. <br/> <br/>       In simpler terms, cloud computing uses a network (most often, the internet) to connect users to a cloud platform where they request and access rented computing services. A central server handles all the communication between client devices and servers to facilitate the exchange of data. Security and privacy features are common components to keep this information secure and safe.  <br/> <br/>      When adopting cloud computing architecture, there is no one-size-fits-all. What works for another company may not suit you and your business needs. In fact, this flexibility and versatility is one of the hallmarks of cloud, allowing enterprises to quickly adapt to changing markets or metrics.  <br/> <br/>      <b>Types of cloud computing deployment models</b>  <br/> <br/><b>Public cloud</b>  <br/> <br/>Public clouds are run by third-party cloud service providers. They offer compute, storage, and network resources over the internet, enabling companies to access shared on-demand resources based on their unique requirements and business goals.  <br/> <br/><b>Private cloud</b><br/><br/>Private clouds are built, managed, and owned by a single organization and privately hosted in their own data centers, commonly known as “on-premises” or “on-prem.” They provide greater control, security, and management of data while still enabling internal users to benefit from a shared pool of compute, storage, and network resources.  <br/> <br/><b>Hybrid cloud</b> <br/><br/>Hybrid clouds combine public and private cloud models, allowing companies to leverage public cloud services and maintain the security and compliance capabilities commonly found in private cloud architectures.  <br/> <br/><b>What are the types of cloud computing services?</b>  <br/> <br/>There are three main types of cloud computing service models that you can select based on the level of control, flexibility, and management your business needs:  <br/> <br/><b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</b>  <br/> <br/>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offers on-demand access to IT infrastructure services, including compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. It provides the highest level of control over your IT resources and most closely resembles traditional on-premises IT resources.<b>Platform as a service (PaaS)</b>Platform as a service (PaaS) offers all the hardware and software resources needed for cloud application development. With PaaS, companies can focus fully on application development without the burden of managing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.  <br/> <br/><b>Software as a service (SaaS)</b>Software as a service (SaaS) delivers a full application stack as a service, from underlying infrastructure to maintenance and updates to the app software itself. A SaaS solution is often an end-user application, where both the service and the infrastructure is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.",

		title: "5 key data compliance regulations to know for 2022",
		category: "Compliance",
		subCategory: ["compliance", "IT - Standards", "Data Security"],
		description:
			"<b>1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b> <br/><br/> The GDPR is the European Union’s (EU) well-publicized answer to concerns over privacy. This law, which went into effect in 2018, gives consumers rights over their own personal data. While the GDPR only applies to companies that serve EU citizens, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with its regulations, even if your customers are based strictly in the United States. Because the GDPR is the most comprehensive regulation in the market, others will likely use it as a guide for their own data protection laws — which may apply to your company.<br/><br/>The GDPR protects personally identifiable information of customers and employees. That is a broad category that can include anything that might identify a person, like: <br/><br/> Names<br/><br/>   Biometric data like fingerprints and facial recognition<br/><br/>Identification numbers like passport numbers, tax identifiers, and national identification numbers<br/><br/> IP addresses<br/><br/> Locations<br/><br/> Telephone numbers <br/><br/> Punishment for noncompliance with the GDPR is a tiered system of fines. Severe or flagrant violations can lead to fines of up to 4% of the company’s global annual turnover or 20 million Euros — and you’ll have to pay the greater amount.   <br/><br/> Several big-name companies have already faced fines for noncompliance with the GDPR. Google was one of the first to be hit with fines — $56.6 million in 2019. In 2021, Meta was fined $255 million for infractions by WhatsApp. That same year, Amazon was fined a whopping $847 million — the largest penalty so far.<br/><br/>   <b> 2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule</b> <br/><br/>      The HIPAA Privacy Rule is a U.S. federal rule protecting Americans’ personal data — in this case, medical records and personal health information. Most importantly, it lays out the responsibilities for safeguarding patient information for healthcare providers and companies that manage health plans. <br/><br/>That’s a crucial function, considering the stakes: Healthcare information can be used to buy fraudulent prescriptions and make fake medical insurance claims. It’s also chockfull of personal information — names, social security numbers, addresses — that can be used for identity theft. That’s incredibly attractive for bad actors — which may explain why the rate of healthcare data breaches almost doubled between 2018 and 2021.<br/><br/>HIPAA’s Privacy Rule also follows a tiered system for annual fines. The maximum fine possible is $1.5 million per year for each category of violation — but that level of punishment is reserved for companies that willfully neglect HIPAA rules by ignoring violations and refusing to fix problems with their privacy procedures.<br/><br/>HIPAA violations usually result in either the company paying its fines or agreeing to a settlement. In 2021, Excellus Health Plan (also known as Excellus BlueCross BlueShield and Univera Healthcare) agreed to a $5.1 million settlement for a massive data breach in 2015 that compromised the patient information of more than 9 million customers. Excellus Health Plan had a number of problems with their approach to security — for one, they didn’t have an adequate process in place to look for security vulnerabilities and didn’t notice the breach until 18 months after it happened.<br/><br/><b>3. Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act</b> <br/><br/>Similar to how HIPAA puts extra responsibility on healthcare organizations to protect their patients’ sensitive health information, the GLB Act mandates that financial institutions take steps to secure their data management systems because of the sensitive nature of their consumers’ information. But instead of healthcare data, this federal data protection law applies to financial institutions and financial service providers in the U.S. — banks, lenders, brokerage firms, debt collectors, and investment advisors.<br/><br/>Private financial information is a tempting data source for hackers because it can be used to open fraudulent credit cards, take out loans, and commit other forms of identity theft. In fact, 86% of data breaches are motivated specifically by financial gain, making it the most common reason for a bad actor to try to access private information.<br/><br/>Noncompliance with the GLB Act can lead to fines, and intentional violations of the law can carry criminal penalties. In 2021, mortgage analytics company Ascension settled a lawsuit that claimed they failed to secure financial information sent to a third-party vendor. It’s a stark reminder that your data privacy responsibilities can extend into your relationship with vendors as well. <br/><br/><b>4. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</b><br/><br/>The FTC Act empowers the FTC to prosecute businesses for “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” — and that includes apps or websites that contain misleading information about privacy and security. This rule applies to all U.S. companies regardless of industry, and it guarantees a wide range of consumer protections and extends well outside of privacy.<br/><br/>The FTC typically issues fines to companies that don’t comply with its regulations. And it continues to levy those fines until the problem is fixed. Companies may agree to a settlement to sort the issue out like Zoom did in 2020 after the FTC alleged that the company published misleading information on its website about the security and encryption of its software. As part of the agreement, Zoom had to agree to improve its security, start a program to manage vulnerabilities, and offer more safeguards like multi-factor authentication to its users.<br/><br/><b>5. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b><br/><br/> The CCPA guarantees rights over personal data — but only for California residents. Under the CCPA (and the California Privacy Rights Act, which will further expand the rule when it goes into effect in 2023), residents have the right to:<br/><br/>Know what information a company collects and how it’s used<br/><br/>Opt-out or opt-in to the sale of their data<br/><br/>Delete the information that has been collected<br/><br/>Non-discrimination<br/><br/>Correct inaccurate records<br/><br/>Limit the usage of their information<br/><br/>Sue a company for a data breach<br/><br/>In most cases, the California Attorney General deals with violations of the CCPA. The state issues fines based on a tiered system, or they may call for civil penalties for noncompliance. However, residents can also sue a company directly if their information is exposed during a data breach, though those cases are rare. Companies even outside of California may choose to follow the regulations in the CCPA for the same reasons they might adopt GDPR standards: This law is likely to become a template for other states that want to protect residents’ privacy.",

		description:
			"The National Institute of Standards and Technology, also known as the NIST, is a United States government laboratory that works to develop, test, and recommend best practices for federal agencies, and other organizations relating to things such as online security. Metrics, measurements, and regulations, like the Federal Information Protection Standard, are created by the NIST to help strengthen the reliability and security of technologies being developed. All federal organizations are required to follow standards outlined by the NIST in their specific field when they are dealing with confidential, federal data. The standards and regulations set out by the NIST are recognized internationally, meaning any organization that follows the NIST’s standards for their business sector is trusted to be using the correct practices in their technology. NIST standards and regulations have been created for many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, from astrophysics to cybersecurity.<br/><br/> <b>Why should you try and be compliant? </b> <br/><br/>One of the many questions asked by organizations is why should I comply with the NIST’s standards and regulations? The main reason is the amount of testing put into the publications they release. Weeks, months, and sometimes years of testing are implemented into the subject NIST publications are related to before they are released to the public. This ensures that methods and practices proposed in the standards are the most up-to-date and methods available at the time of writing. The research is done by a team of professionals in their field, so the publications released to the public are extremely accurate, both informationally and technically.<br/><br/>Another reason to comply with the NIST’s standards is the fact that it will make your organizations infrastructure and new technologies much more secure. The goal of releasing NIST publications is to provide a more secure environment for both the government and companies in general. The more organizations that follow these standards, the less security breaches and vulnerabilities are available for exploitation by threat actors. Some regulations, like the Federal Information Protection Standard (FIPS), are required for work with the federal government. This means, any company seeking federal work contracts, will need to be FIPS 140-2 compliant, along with potentially needing to comply with other regulations, depending on the organizations field.<br/><br/> Compliance can also provide your business with an edge over competitors. Those organizations that comply with federal security standards will appeal to customers over those businesses who don’t comply. Those same customers will trust your organization to produce an equally secure product or service in the future, winning your company future business with a recurring client. Some organizations will require compliance with specific regulations if a company wishes to be their vendor. One of these organizations is the United States federal government.<br/><br/><b>Who needs to be NIST compliant? </b> <br/><br/>All contractors, vendors, subcontractors, and all federal agencies are required to be compliant with NIST standards and regulations if they wish to work with the United States federal government. This is due to the sensitive data that companies working with the government will be manipulating, storing, and processing. If the data is handled improperly, this could cause a security gap allowing threat actors access to information or services that are meant to be top secret. Certain organizations, as well as local governments, may require those companies wishing to work with them to comply with certain NIST standards and regulations as well. <br/><br/> <b> How do you comply with regulations and standards?</b> <br/><br/> One of the easiest ways to follow NIST regulations is to comply with the requirements set forth in the NIST publications. These requirements are specific to each publication, meaning following the requirements of one publication will not guarantee compliance with all NIST publications. To help your company with being compliant with current and future publications created by the National Institute of Science and Technology, you should utilize the Cybersecurity Framework, created by the NIST. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework does not guarantee compliance with all current publications, rather it is a set of uniform standards that can be applied to most companies.<br/><br/>The NIST Cybersecurity Framework was created to improve the cybersecurity of organizations to prevent data breaches and increase the strength of cybersecurity tactics used by organizations. By implementing a uniform set of standards, organizations following the Cybersecurity Framework will already understand the infrastructure and cybersecurity tactics used by other Cybersecurity Framework organizations. The Cybersecurity Framework is broken into 5 stages, called the Framework Core:<br/><br/> <b>identify</b><br/><br/>The Identify stage helps the rest of the Framework Core function properly. This stage provides transparency into the workings of the tools currently in use, while prioritizing actions for securing critical infrastructure. Companies implementing this stage will identify all of the software and systems that are critical to the organization’s infrastructure. This helps find unauthorized devices within the network, such as a worker’s phone that is accessing their email, which could be used as an attack vector for threat actors. Understanding the systems at play in your infrastructure helps identify where most of the secure data is kept, which can then be prioritized for protection. All data cannot be protected within an organization, thus secure data has a priority for protection. Asset management, risk assessment, and risk management strategy are all tasks that fall under the Identify stage.<br/><br/> <b>Protect</b><br/><br/>The protect phase is focused on reducing the number of breaches and other cybersecurity events that occur in your infrastructure. It also handles mitigating the damage a breach will cause if it occurs. This could mean putting security systems in to prevent or detect data loss, such as intruder prevention systems, or other such cybersecurity tools. Identity access and management (IAM) control, training, and data security are just a few of the processes that fall under the protection umbrella.<br/><br/> <b>Detect </b><br/><br/>This stage helps with the detection of an intruder once a breach occurs, as no security system is 100% secure. Once an attacker gets into your organization’s infrastructure, they must be detected and dealt with in a timely manner, so they do not have enough time to steal any data or compromise any client systems. The longer it takes to detect an intruder, the more data that could be compromised. Events, monitoring, and detection are all a part of the Detect stage. <br/><br/> <b>Respond</b><br/><br/>The respond stage deals with the response an organization has to a breach. These guidelines help with developing and implementing a plan to respond to a security breach. If the breach is not secured and the attacker is given free reign of an organization, then the breach can become worse and worse. Response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation, and improvements are the steps implemented in the Respond phase.<br/><br/> <b>Recover</b><br/><br/>The final stage, Recover, deals with the aftermath of a security breach. A plan for disaster recovery is created and implemented here. A back-up of all databases and infrastructure should be in place as part of the recovery plan. This stage includes recovery planning, communications, and improvements for the future.",

		description:
			"<b>What is Digital Forensics?</b> <br/><br/><b>Digital forensics is a forensic science branch that deals with recovering, investigating, and preserving digital evidence while upholding legal standards.</b><br/><br/>The global forensics industry is expected to generate around $27,705 million by 2028, according to the 2022 forensic technologies market report by Vantage Market Research. This figure makes sense because of the world’s constant, dynamic technological advancements. <br/><br/>        The global forensics industry is expected to generate around $27,705 million by 2028, according to the 2022 forensic technologies market report by Vantage Market Research. This figure makes sense because of the world’s constant, dynamic technological advancements.     <br/><br/>  The computer used to be a lone server in a corporate setting. Now, a computer sits within all aspects of everyday life. Computers are a part of smartwatches, mobile phones, CCTV systems, or even smart sprinkler systems. No industry can progress without embedding digital technology into its processes. The internet of things has enabled various consumer systems to connect to each other. <br/><br/> <b> ‘Computer forensics’ </b>was the first term to be used for the investigation of computer-related crimes. The FBI launched the first computer forensics program in 1984, and the first honeypot trap was created in 1986 by Cliff Stoll at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Computer forensics took off as a profession, mainly to curb the spread of child pornography. <br/><br/>  Subsequently, the term digital forensics began to be used, covering any piece of technology that holds digital data. We use the terms digital forensics, computer forensics, and cyber forensics interchangeably.<br/><br/>  Forensics is typically associated with the analysis of any crime scene. After a robbery, for example, the crime scene is combed for fingerprints and anything else that may lead to DNA evidence. With digital forensics, a device becomes the crime scene. The investigator tries to figure out who accessed it, what was stored on it, what could have been deleted, etc. <br/><br/>        Two groups of people mainly use digital forensics:<br/><br/><b>Law enforcement agencies in criminal and civil cases:</b> These agencies use digital evidence to aid suspects’ convictions or acquittals. These cases can vary from murder trials to civil cases such as those involving transfer of property.<br/><br/><b>Incident response teams in organizations:</b> These teams are the first responders to cyber attacks such as data breaches or ransomware threats. They use digital forensics to investigate the points of entry and possible remediation.<br/><br/>Specific events in corporate settings trigger digital forensic investigations. These events include abnormal activity in the network or servers, corporate espionage, cyberattacks, intellectual property theft, bankruptcy investigations, or industry compliance audits. <br/><br/>The end goal of cyber forensics is to conduct a structured investigation informed by guidelines, resulting in a document. This document must be ready for use as proof in a court of law or in audit offices.<br/><br/>A cyber forensics investigator is an expert with a bachelor’s (or higher) degree in computer forensics. This professional must have the knack for understanding criminal intent and follow the investigation thread accordingly.<br/><br/>‘Digital evidence’ depends on the device type being scraped through. This can be anything from user account data to electronic door logs. Investigators can gather two types of digital evidence:<br/><br/>      <b>  Volatile data:</b> Volatile data is digital information stored in a temporary medium. This data is lost when the device is powered off. The most common volatile data in a digital forensics investigation is random access memory (RAM). Other examples are network connections, open files, running processes, and active sessions. Usually, one can gather some residual data from these sources.<br/><br/><b>Nonvolatile data:</b> Nonvolatile data is digital information stored in permanent mediums, such as hard disks. The data is not lost even when the device is switched off. Nonvolatile data includes system files, event logs, dump files, configuration files, and account information. This data is less tricky to retrieve for evidence purposes than volatile data.<br/><br/>Digital forensics tools can be hardware- or software-based. These tools are used to inspect devices while maintaining the integrity of the data. Some standard tools are:<br/><br/><b>File analysis tools:</b> These tools extract and analyze individual files.<br/><br/><b>Network analysis tools:</b> These are predominantly network monitoring tools that extract traffic and payload information.<br/><br/><b>Database analyzers:</b> These tools extract, analyze, and query the database to gather the necessary information.<br/><br/><b>registry tools: </b>Windows-based computing systems maintain user activity in something called registries. These tools gather information from them.<br/><br/><b>Data capture tools: </b>These tools capture data, both encrypted and otherwise. They provide a window into persistent hard disks and enable data extraction without damaging original content.<br/><br/><b>Email scanners:</b> They scan all email communications for evidence. These are important for investigating social engineering attacks.<br/><br/><b>Mobile device scanners: </b>These devices scan internal and mobile memories in mobile devices. <br/><br/>The computer forensics process is reactive–an investigation that kicks off after the occurrence of an event. It is separate from the cybersecurity process that an organization must include for overall security posture. Cybersecurity measures make sure that such events are proactively minimized.      <br/><br/>      <b>Digital Forensics Process</b> <br/><br/>Digital forensics, no matter what type, requires a preconceived and systematic approach. Several digital forensic process models exist that can be followed. The steps in each of these models vary based on the goal of the investigation: law enforcement, auditing, or incident response. <br/><br/>No matter which model is adopted, a few steps are common across all of them, such as:<br/><br/><b>Step 1: Investigation eparation</b>This is the first stage of any cyber forensic investigation. Here, investigators ensure they have the right tools and people. This ultimately depends on the type of event that is being investigated. <br/><br/>In the case of a legal investigation, the investigation team obtains a search authority. In a criminal case, the search authority comes with a search warrant or a subpoena. In a civil case, it might just be consent to a search. <br/><br/>Forensic tools are validated at this stage too. Investigators must clear each piece of hardware and software of issues and have their accuracy verified. This is especially important for new and old tools with new upgrades or patches. Sometimes, one may need a second round of validation before the analysis stage. Every time this validation is done, it needs to be documented. <br/><br/>The processes mentioned above are crucial. If done incorrectly, it negates any findings from the investigation and cannot be used in court. <br/><br/>In the case of incident response, external investigation teams require an SLA (service-level agreement), while internal teams just need to establish their chain of command. Once this is done, a list of possible digital devices and systems is created. This is done by looking for a digital footprint.<br/><br/>The digital footprint traces an activity. For example, in the case of intellectual property theft, investigators look into the suspect’s behavior on the system. This includes the applications they accessed, which websites they visited, and what devices were used. Tracing the digital footprint produces a list of assets. The items on this list are then seized for in-depth analysis, keeping the criminal intent in mind.<br/><br/><b>Step 2: Evidence identification</b>Once the initial details and legalities are determined, the second step is identifying the evidence and finding where it is stored.<br/><br/>During this stage, it is essential to document the evidence, where it is stored, and the format in which it is stored. This could be an email or a video clip that indicates the event being investigated. <br/><br/><b>Step 3: Collection of evidence</b>The collection stage of digital forensics involves carefully extracting this evidence while ensuring no damage occurs. Sometimes, this step is as straightforward as making a hard disk copy and combing through it.<br/><br/>However, it might not be as simple as it seems in all scenarios. This step can also involve recovering deleted files or cracking passwords to gain access. <br/><br/>Data is also examined at this stage and whittled down where necessary. When the haystack is smaller, the needle is easier to find. Once the data becomes accessible, it is isolated and secured. Backups are created, making sure all content and metadata are the same.<br/><br/><b>Step 4: Evidence preservation</b>The original data that acts as digital evidence is now isolated and cannot be handled by anyone without authority. Forensic images are exact copies of digital proof, done at the bit level (0 or 1). The process of generating this bitstream image is called imaging.<br/><br/>Hashing is a mathematical algorithm that processes the original bitstream and the images. The hashing function creates a unique value for every unique bitstream it processes. These hashes are treated as the ‘fingerprints’ of the digital evidence. An image and the original digital evidence are deemed the same if their fingerprints match.<br/><br/>A chain of custody is established and documented during this stage. This chain of custody is crucial, especially if this evidence is to be used in court. It is a detailed account of the digital evidence, from when it was retrieved to when it is presented in court or to an auditing team. Each time evidence changes hands, it is noted next to a description of that piece of evidence at that point in time.<br/><br/><b>Step 5: Information analysis</b>All relevant digital data is examined during this stage, and the most relevant parts are analyzed and extracted. This relevant information is converted into a format one can use to present to the stakeholders or the court.<br/><br/>The amount of time spent in this stage depends on the facts of the event. In some cases, it might stretch over a long period. It is essential to keep the circumstances and facts of the investigation in mind here.<br/><br/>During the analysis stage, investigators try to establish a timeline, identify connections, locate illegal content such as child pornography, and determine whether a system has fallen victim to malware or any other form of cyber attack. <br/><br/>By the end of this stage, investigators form conclusions. An example would be marking ‘likely’ to a question such as ‘Has this USB drive been tampered with?’.<br/><br/>his step may take many iterations to reach a desired point of closure. Each action in this stage is documented in the interest of repeatability. Repeatability is required so that an authorized third party can reach the same conclusions by following the same steps with the same tools on the same piece of evidence. This establishes the authenticity of the investigation.<br/><br/><b>Step 6: Report presentation</b><br/><br/>Documentation is a step that runs alongside every stage of the digital forensic process. Once the investigation is completed, a post-investigation document covers all findings. The format of this document must be in line with the requirements of the court or client.<br/><br/>Most forensic tools also auto-generate their reports to be consumed by experts. These are technical and cannot be understood by everyone.<br/><br/>This is where the presentation part comes in. The presentation of these reports varies based on the intended audience. For instance, in a court of law, the presentation must be simple enough for the judge and jury to understand while covering the steps taken to acquire the evidence. The presentation can make or break a case in someone’s favor.<br/><br/>After a cybercrime incident, a more technically detailed report does the trick in a technical setup. This report will be the starting point for remediations and possible changes in infrastructure.<br/><br/>Through all these steps, the digital forensic investigation team ensures that:<br/><br/>No data is lost, modified, or overlookedAll analyzed information is the same as the original data extractedDocumentation of every person, tool, and action is carried out. A chain of custody is established<br/><br/><b>Why is Digital Forensics Important?</b><br/><br/>Regardless of the industry vertical, businesses are rapidly evolving due to technological advancements. While this has led to streamlined processes and increased efficiency, it has also increased the attack surface. An attack surface is the multiple points of entry that leave an organization open to external threats.<br/><br/>In a business setting, digital forensics is crucial to incident response and compliance auditing. Investigators must submit the forensic investigation’s documented findings if the incident has a legal aspect. <br/><br/>Regulations such as HIPAA require security and privacy controls within the organization’s systems. In case of data breaches, digital forensic reports can also prove to the regulatory bodies that the organization has met all these requirements. <br/><br/>Besides, a thorough forensic investigation also leads to the uncovering of other vulnerabilities. Viruses and malware unrelated to the case and yet harmful to the systems may crop up. Organizations can leverage forensic reports to improve their security hygiene.<br/><br/>Digital forensics is also used to recover stolen or lost data. Damage analysis is a part of the process.<br/><br/>In a world where the internet provides a cloak of anonymity, digital forensics helps stop online harassment and fraud. All law enforcement agencies now have a cyber cell to deal with these crimes. It even helps defense departments keep track of unusual military activity.<br/><br/>In 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea, Russian troops were accused of operating in parts of Ukraine. Russia vehemently denied this. Meanwhile, a Russian sergeant, Alexander Sotkin, was discovered to have posted his selfies on Instagram. Instagram photos are geotagged, so one can easily glean the location of these photographs. It was discovered that he was an on-duty soldier moving between his military base in Russia and certain parts of Ukraine. <br/><br/>This is a basic digital forensic example. As cyber warfare has started picking up worldwide, government bodies are preparing digital forensic teams to be ready for battle.<br/><br/>Digital forensics is vital in civil and criminal courts now that human lives have become inextricably entangled with devices. One example of a criminal case that was resolved using digital forensics is the murder of a 67-year-old woman in San Jose, California. The prime suspect alleged that he had met her before she died. The woman was wearing a Fitbit, a fitness tracker that tracks her heart rate. Data gathered from the Fitbit indicated the exact time of the murder. That, combined with CCTV footage from her house, proved that the prime suspect had lied and was with her during her death, and was duly convicted.<br/><br/>A high-profile criminal arrest aided by cyber forensics was that of a serial killer who named himself ‘The BTK Killer’. The killer, who had a habit of sending cryptic notes to police officers, made the mistake of sending a note on a Microsoft Word document on a floppy disk. Digital forensic investigators could trace the metadata they had extracted from the disk to the killer’s identity.",
